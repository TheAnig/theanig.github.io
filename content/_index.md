Hi, I’m TheAnig!
I’m a software engineer based in the Bay Area with a passion for cats, programming, and video games.
This website is my personal space where I document and share my projects, thoughts, and explorations in tech.

I hold an M.S. in Computer Science from Ohio State, where my research focused on Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Applied Machine Learning, Data Platforms, and Data Pipelines.
While most of my work is in closed-source projects, I’m working on actively contributing to open-source in my free time and exploring new ideas in software development.
