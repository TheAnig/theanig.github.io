others. Traditional methods of linguistic analysis have been done historically and they’ve had\nlimited sucess. The aim of this study is to find out whether a machine learning solely on its own, is\nable to learn more effectively.\n\nIntroduction\nIt is widely known fact that in literature there are some quotes that are more memorable than others. In order to capture this essence of what makes the quote memorable, techniques have been devised based on linguistic expertise to hand pick features that is believed to contribute to making the quote memorable. The limitation of this approach is not only the fact that these generated features scale poorly from dataset to dataset, their performance is also upper-bounded by the quality of the features that are used.\nIn this project, I try to overcome some of these limitations by applying a supervised machine learning technique that ’‘learns’’ what makes the quotes memorable.\nLiterature Review\nText Aesthetics 2014\n“Automatic prediction of text aesthetics and interestingness” D Ganguly et al (2014)\n\nUsed statistical features (discussed below)\nKindle dataset similar to the one I’ve acquired\n56% accuracy\nA comparative study on Naive Bayes, one class SVM, binary SVM\nOne class performed best\nUsed the “mapping convergence” algorithm\nThey apply SVDD to reduce impact of outliers\nRely on average length of word, positional difference, POS features include adjectives and adverbs, sentiword net distance, and semantic distance.\nUsed a distance formula extensively, no idea why, only appears in this paper (probably something to do with MC SVM?)\n\n$$F(p) = \\frac{2}{N*(N-1)}*\\sum_{i=1}^N\\sum_{j=i+1}^N\\frac{d(j) - d(i)}{j-i}$$\nBendersky 2012\n “A Dictionary of Wisdom and Wit: Learning to Extract Quotable Phrases” Bendersky et al (2012) \n\n( Most closely resembles the idea I had in mind)\nEstablishes features used in subsequent works by other people\nBasic pipeline involves,\nTake a book, feed sentences to Naive Bayes filter that uses log likelihood to reject most of the “unquotable” text.\nThe naive Bayes filter is trained on external sets of quotes independent of the quotes from the book\nThe output set of sentences from the NB filter is then fed into a classifier.\nUsed a quotable language model involving selected lexical, POS and punctuation features.\nThe model is a unigram  model with sentence likelihood\nPaper strongly focuses on what makes quotable phrase quotable\nNaive Bayes filter\n\nReduces noise (around 60% of text fed to it from a book is rejected)\nHigh recall is important as that’s the only thing used\nMeasured by testing against a foreign set of quotable phrases to see how many pass\n\n\nQuotable Phrase detection (classifier)\n\nPass a set of sentences from NB filter to single perceptron layer\nIts labelled dataset and is trained using features mentioned above\nThey use “quotable” classified sentences and post them on /r/Quotes subreddit then average the score to see how well their classifier performs\n\n\n\nMemorability 2012\n“You had me at hello: How phrasing affects memorability” Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al (2012).\n\nUsed a corpus of movie quotes\nAlso used a corpus of common language (news article) “Brown corpus”.\nUse two sets of features: generality and distinctiveness.\nDistinctiveness is calculated using likelihood w.r.t the Brown corpus.\nGenerality is calculated using personal pronouns, indefinite articles, tense etc.\nPerformed a comparison of %age of memorable and non-memorable quotes that contain the above features\nUse 1,2,3-gram Language Models and 1,2,3-gram with POS tagged Language models\nOf each quote pair memorable is found 60% of the time to be distinct using their distinctiveness measure\nAlso included slogans from advertising and ad campaigns\nUsed distinctiveness metric and generalisability metric\nUsed SVM to get 60% accuracy, concluded that there is something memorable about these quotes\n\nKoto 2014\n “Memorable spoken quote corpora of TED public speaking” Koto et al (2014) \n\nThey crossed the domains of quotability/memorability of text with speech processing\nUsed TED talk dataset\nPopularity of quote is estimated by the amount of “shares” it has on the website\nConcluded that there is something that influences memorability of text using F0 metric from INTERSPEECH ‘09\n\nKoto 2015\n “A Study On Natural Expressive Speech: Automatic Memorable Spoken Quote Detection” Koto et al (2015) \n\nContinuation of 2014 work, added features from Bendersky 2012 to extract quotability\nIntroduced two new POS features in quote detection\nDropped punctuation features as the data is speech based, added some acoustic features to improve speech processing\nCompared Naive Bayes, Neural Networks and SVMs\nUsed Bendersky 2012’s features on the TED talk data set as baseline performance for the 3 methods\nNaive Bayes gets them highest performance,\nThe feature set gives them 70.4% accuracy over 60% of baseline\n\nKoto 2016\n “Automatic Detection of Memorable Spoken Quotes” Koto et al (2016) \n\nExtension of 2015 work, performed some analysis on best features to haveselect.\n\nMethod\nAt its core, the given task can be formulated as a text classification problem. As such, I plan to employ the traditional methods for text classification and then tweak them for the task at hand. From current literature available literature that compares the performance of these techniques on the standard IMDb dataset, I have chosen TextCNN (using the GloVe embeddings) as focal technique that will be applied to the problem to see how it compares to the existing techniques discussed above.\nTextCNN model was chosen because of its flexibility that allows for a lot more granular tweaking which can help increase performance for our given task.\nThe test hypothesis for this project is to check whether this model is able to match the performance of the traditional techniques in their respective data and see how it performs.\nTraditionally all the papers listed above in the literature review employ a balanced dataset, however this is not indicative of the real-world scenario where quotable text is much rarer than non-quotable text. Hence I have decided to improve on this by testing various amounts of imbalanced datasets (imbalanced in favour of non-quotable text)\nAlso since the aim is to create a generalizable model that can be applied to a wide collection of tasks I start with balanced dataset and then see the impact of creating imbalance.\nI test a 50-50 split, a 60-40 split, 70-30 split, 80-20 split and 90-10 split on the generated dataset.\nTextCNN\nThe TextCNN model hyperparameters were tweaked according to Zhang’s paper [“A Sensitivity Analysis of (and Practitioners’ Guide to) Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification” Zhang et al.] , with GloVe 6B, 300dim vectors.\nFilter Size of 3, 4, 5 was used as it unconditionally yields the best result as shown in the paper. A batch size of 50 was used and a dropout of 0.5 was added to prevent overfitting. The model that we are using here is also double channeled.\nExperiments\nData\nThe data used in the experiments are as follows,\n\nLitQuotes - around 2300 book quotes were scraped off of LitQuotes.com and paired up with non-quotes from same books available via Project Gutenberg.\nQuotationspage.com - 5100 general quotes which are paired with random non-quote newspaper dataset.\nData from Memorability 2012’s paper - 2197 one-sentence memorable quotes paired with surrounding non-memorable quotes from the same movie, spoken by the same character and containing the same number of words.\n\nThis gets us around 9,000 pairs of quotes and non-quotes.\nMetrics\nTo measure the sucess of the system, I used F-1 score this was important as due to the skewing of the dataset, accuracy would be a bad indicator of performance as in a 90-10 split, a dumb classifier that predicts one label all the time would also yields a 90% accuracy which doesn’t accurately represent the fact that the classifier hasn’t learnt any useful feature from our dataset.\nBaselines\nThe baseline we take is 70.4% which is the best that has been achieved on a similar dataset. Though I have augmented that data set with a substantial amounts of quotes, the paper only has 2000 or so memorable quotes, while in this project I have augmented that to around 9000. This is solely because 2000 quotes is very little for Deep Learning based methods to learn anything meaningful from.\nPerformance and Results of the method\n\nBalanced (50-50) Dataset\n\nF-Score :  0.9417280643\n\n\n60-40 Dataset\n\nF-Score :  0.914163090129\n\n\n70-30 Dataset\n\nF-Score :  0.898954703833\n\n\n80-20 Dataset\n\nF-Score :  0.892349356804\n\n\n90-10 Dataset\n\nF-Score :  0.863253402463\n\n\n\nThis is a substaintial increase from the baseline, thus proving what I set out to, i.e., deep learning based methods are extremely accurate in discerning the quotability measure of a given sentence. These results support the hypotheis hence, in Future Work, I would like to see what are the additional features that the Deep Learning based methods generate that are able to capture the essence of quotability more accurately than the domain experts.\nNote: Since the data for quotable text was limited, during the various higher-order splits, I just increased the amount of non-quotable text to dilute the quotable text data. So a 90-10 split has 74,000 total of quotable and non-quotable text.\nConclusions\nThough one of the main contributing factors that contributed to me choosing TextCNN was its speed and relative ease of implementation, after the experiments it is evident that the CNN is able to perform much better than human generated features for the same classifcation task. As to exactly what more information is a CNN able to extract that the linguists might have overlooked is uncertain, we can make some speculations to conclude what exactly is going on behind the scenes that justifies this performance bump. One of the biggest contributing factor that I would assume would be the GloVe word embeddings, that have a very interesting property of capturing word’s meaning numerically. This leads to the CNN understanding the implications of words in a quotable vs a non-quotable text, this combined with the ability of CNNs to auto-generate abstract representations of certain advanced grammatical structures, must have contributed in its ability to yield better results.  “Modeling Interestingness with Deep Neural Networks” Gao, J., Pantel, P., Gamon, M., He, X., &amp; Deng, L.

When a client connects, it sends a selector string, which can be empty, to the server. The server processes this request and responds with either:\nA directory listing containing item types, user-visible names, selector strings, hostnames, and port numbers.\nA document consisting of a simple text block terminated by a period on a line by itself.\nFor a full-text search query (type 7), the client sends a query string in addition to the selector, and the server responds with a virtual directory containing matching entries.\nThe protocol’s simplicity allows debugging via telnet by manually sending requests and observing responses.\nDeveloping for Gopher\nDeveloping Gopher content involves structuring a gophermap file that defines how clients interpret and present your data. A typical Gopher menu might look like this:\n\nGopher Search Engines\nSeveral search services index Gopherspace and provide full-text search capabilities:\n\nFloodgap (gopher://gopher.floodgap.com): A well-maintained Gopher search and directory service.\nGopherpedia: A Gopher version of Wikipedia.\n\nConclusion\nExploring the Gopher protocol has been a fascinating journey into the early days of the internet.\nReading about it has motivated me to set up my own blog on Gopherspace as a fun side project.\nIf I have the free time, I might even try to build a Gopher server/creating some kind of analogue to the static site generators we have today.\n","id":"https://theanig.github.io/blog/gopher-protocol/","title":"Exploring the Gopher Protocol"},"https://theanig.github.io/blog/hello-world-migrating/":{"body":"A New Home for My Documentation\nWhen I first started documenting my work on my old Google Sites website,\nI had a simple goal: to have a public copy of the work I was doing and had done.\nIt was a way for me to track my progress, organize my thoughts, and maybe even help someone else who stumbled upon it.\nI didn’t put much thought into longevity—I assumed that once something was on the web, it would remain accessible in some form, either through archiving or persistence in search engine indexes.\nHowever, I recently realized that’s not necessarily true.\nDespite the internet’s reputation for permanence, entire platforms can disappear, and with them, the content we rely on.\nMy Google Sites blog was deleted because my blogging account was removed due to inactivity.\nThe account was tied to my OSU account, which I used heavily at the time but lost access to after graduation.\nGoogle likely attempted to notify me, but since I no longer had access to the account, I missed any warnings and lost my content permanently.\nThis served as a wake-up call: if I want my work to endure, I need to be more intentional about where and how I host it.\nGithub Pages: A Fresh Start\nTo ensure my blog remains accessible,\nI’ve migrated everything to GitHub Pages, now under a custom domain.\nNot only does this give me greater control over my content, but it also allows me to embrace best practices for independent publishing.\nAs I work on re-adding the content from my old site, I’m planning to do a better job of actively sharing and promoting my work, this time around.\nI’ve also decided to start fresh with a new theme and a more focused approach to my content.\nMy old blog was run on Jekyll, now I’m using Zola, a static site generator written in Rust,\nwhich I find more enjoyable to work with and more aligned with my current interests.\nWhile thinking about how to maintain my blog,\nI came across the Indie Web movement and the Small Web community.\nThese communities of creators emphasize ownership over their own content, avoiding dependency on centralized platforms, and fostering genuine connections among like-minded individuals.\nI find this philosophy fascinating—rather than relying on social media algorithms to dictate reach, the Indie Web encourages a more direct, human approach to sharing ideas and work.\nSince the work that I want to share is kind of niche, technical and somewhat personal, I love the idea, especially since I don’t plan to monetize my blog, I don’t need to worry about SEO or ad revenue.\nPOSSE: Publish on My Own Site First Philosophy\nA key principle in the Indie Web movement is POSSE (Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere).\nThis means my primary content will always live on my own domain, and I will share it across different platforms as needed.\nThis ensures that my work remains under my control while still reaching a wider audience through syndication.\nPOSSE is an evolution of POSE (Publish Once, Syndicate Everywhere), which is more flexible but lacks the strong emphasis on self-hosting.\nAs I integrate these principles into my workflow, I hope to build a blog that is both enduring and easily shareable.\nWhat’s Next?\nGoing forward, I’ll be restoring old posts and actively maintaining my blog as a long-term resource.\nI’ll also experiment with tools and strategies that align with the Indie Web philosophy, ensuring that my content remains accessible, independent, and useful.\nIf you’re interested in similar ideas, I’d love to hear from you!

These models have revolutionized computer vision by leveraging spatial coherence to extract patterns, enabling machines to distinguish cats from dogs, recognize handwritten digits, and even detect tumors in medical scans. However, as powerful as CNNs are, they come with limitations—particularly their reliance on convolution operations, which are heavily tuned for two-dimensional data.\nWhat if there were an alternative to convolutions?\nOne that could preserve spatial relationships while offering a fresh perspective on how we process and interpret image data?\nEnter fractals, the infinitely complex, self-replicating structures that bridge mathematics and nature.\nIn this blog post, I’ll explore how fractal geometry, specifically the Hilbert curve, can provide a novel approach to feature extraction.\nThis method reimagines image processing by transforming pixel data into a dense, one-dimensional representation using fractal-based mappings. Unlike traditional techniques, it takes advantage of the Hilbert curve’s ability to preserve locality and scale across resolutions, making it ideal for compact, efficient feature representation. Combined with wavelet transforms, which localize features in the frequency domain, this fractal-based approach opens up exciting possibilities for image classification and beyond.\nFractals: A brief overview\nA fractal is an abstract object used to describe and simulate naturally occurring objects. The proper definition of a fractal, at least as Mandelbrot wrote it, is a shape whose “Hausdorff dimension” is greater than its “topological dimension”.\nTopological dimension is something that’s always an integer, wherein (loosely speaking) curve-ish things are 1-dimensional, surface-ish things are two-dimensional, etc. For example, a Koch Curve has topological dimension 1, and Hausdorff dimension 1.262. A rough surfaces might have topological dimension 2, but fractal dimension 2.3. And if a curve with topological dimension 1 has a Hausdorff dimension that happens to be exactly 2, or 3, or 4, etc., it would be considered a fractal, even though it’s fractal dimension is an integer.\nFor purposes of my method we can simplify our view of fractal as essentially a never-ending pattern.\nBut even under fractals, there is a special set of self-similar fractals. These are rendered by repeating a simple process. The interesting property about fractals is that they exist in non-whole number dimensions, as discussed above (The Hausdorff dimension). This property is super-useful as this means that they effectively encode information from a non-primary dimension, a fact that was used extensively for lossy image compression.\nWe can use to our advantage this property to capture spatial, temporal or higher dimensional relation- ships in form of useful features that can be localized. (Using something like a Fourier transform or as in our case, wavelet transform)\nSpace-Filling Curves and Practical Applications\nBefore diving into the technicalities, let’s talk about space-filling curves. These are mathematical constructions that, despite their counterintuitive nature, are immensely useful. A space-filling curve is a line that weaves through every point in a two-dimensional (or higher-dimensional) space. One famous example is the Hilbert curve, which can be visualized as a fractal that becomes progressively more intricate at higher resolutions.\nBridging Infinite and Finite Realities\nSpace-filling curves address a philosophical question central to mathematics: How can results based on infinite concepts be useful in our finite world? The Hilbert curve provides a fascinating answer. It starts as a theoretical construct, existing in an infinite, continuous mathematical space. But its finite approximations—pseudo-Hilbert curves—serve practical purposes, such as translating images into sound or encoding spatial information into dense, one-dimensional representations.\n\n\n\nThe Mandelbrot set: its boundary is a fractal curve with Hausdorff dimension 2. Courtesy of Wikipedia\n\n\nLet me illustrate with an example: Imagine developing a device that helps people “see with their ears.” The device takes data from a camera, translates it into sound, and lets users interpret spatial information through auditory cues. In this setup, the Hilbert curve provides a way to map 2D image data (pixels) into a 1D frequency space, preserving spatial relationships between pixels while creating a coherent auditory representation.\nFractals in Feature Extraction: The Proposed Methodology\nFractals, with their self-similar and infinitely intricate structures, provide a powerful framework for extracting meaningful features from complex datasets like images [1]. The goal is to transform 2D image data into a dense, 1D representation that preserves spatial relationships and is optimized for computational efficiency. This section breaks down the methodology into three key components: mapping pixels to frequencies, employing the Hilbert curve for serialization, and leveraging wavelet transforms for localization and compression.\nFrom Pixels to Frequencies: Bridging the Dimensions\nAt the heart of the method is the challenge of mapping two-dimensional pixel data to a one-dimensional frequency domain.\nEach pixel is associated with a frequency, and its intensity determines the loudness of that frequency in the resulting signal.\nThis transformation enables image data to be represented as a superposition of frequencies, much like a musical composition where different instruments (frequencies) contribute to the overall sound [2].\nThe challenge lies in ensuring that this mapping preserves spatial coherence. Pixels that are close together in the original image should remain close in the frequency representation [3]. This is critical for maintaining the integrity of spatial relationships, which are often key to successful image classification. Without this coherence, the resulting representation would lose its ability to accurately capture the structure of the original image.\nComparing Space Filling Curves\nSpace-filling curves provide a structured way to map multi-dimensional data into one-dimensional representations while attempting to preserve spatial locality. However, not all space-filling curves are created equal. When choosing a curve for applications like image feature extraction, it’s crucial to evaluate their performance in preserving spatial relationships. Let’s compare three popular curves: the Z-curve, the Peano curve, and the Hilbert curve. [4]\nThe Z-Curve\n\n\n\nThe Z-curve, or Morton order, follows a zig-zag pattern that makes it simple to implement but poor at preserving spatial relationships. In 2D, the Z-curve introduces significant gaps, with many adjacent points in the sequence mapping to coordinates that are far apart in the original space. This results in an average displacement for unit edges exceeding 1.6 in 2D and 1.35 in higher dimensions, making it unsuitable for applications requiring strong locality preservation.\nPeano Curve\n\n\n\nThe Peano curve, in contrast, is much better at maintaining spatial coherence. By mapping scalar unit lengths in 1D to unit Euclidean lengths in 2D, it ensures that horizontal segments are exactly one unit long, although vertical segments can stretch to 2 or 5 units, slightly raising the average displacement. The Peano curve also achieves asymptotic stability at higher ranks, with its performance aligning closely with the Hilbert curve as resolution increases.\nHilbert Curve\n\n\n\nHilbert curve stands out as the best option for preserving locality. Its recursive, self-similar structure ensures that adjacent points in the sequence remain as close as possible in the original space, outperforming the Peano curve in both horizontal and vertical coherence. The Hilbert curve also scales well to higher dimensions, maintaining its locality-preserving properties regardless of resolution. Studies such as Color-Space Dimension Reduction and Bongki 2001 consistently rate the Hilbert curve as the superior choice, edging out the Peano curve in overall performance.\nImplementation\nTo achieve a mapping that preserves spatial relationships, I turn to the Hilbert curve, a type of fractal known as a space-filling curve. The Hilbert curve provides an elegant solution to the problem of mapping 2D space to 1D space while preserving locality. Here’s why it’s so effective:\n\n\nLocality Preservation: Points that are close together on the Hilbert curve are also close together in the 2D image. This ensures that nearby pixels are mapped to nearby frequencies, preserving spatial coherence.\n\n\nScalability: The Hilbert curve is recursive and self-similar, meaning it can scale to any resolution. Whether the image is 256x256 or 512x512 pixels, the curve adapts seamlessly, providing a consistent framework for feature extraction.\n\n\nStability Across Resolutions: As the resolution of an image increases, the points on the Hilbert curve move less and less. This stability is crucial for applications where the resolution may change over time, such as progressive updates to image datasets or hierarchical processing pipelines.\n\n\nThe Process of Hilbertification\n\n\nAnimation showing Hilbert Curve spanning an image of various resolutions. Courtesy of Wikipedia\n\nHilbertification refers to the process of mapping an image’s pixel data to a 1D representation using the Hilbert curve. Here’s how it works:\n\n\nDivide the Image into Quadrants: The Hilbert curve starts by dividing the image into smaller regions, or quadrants, and defining a path that traverses each quadrant in a specific order.\n\n\nRecursive Subdivision: Each quadrant is further subdivided into smaller grids, with the Hilbert curve path becoming increasingly intricate. This process repeats until the curve has visited every pixel in the image.\n\n\nGenerate a 1D Sequence: The final result is a 1D sequence of pixel intensities, where the order of the pixels reflects the traversal path of the Hilbert curve. This sequence forms the input for subsequent signal processing steps.\n\n\nWavelet Transforms for Feature Localization and Compression\nAfter Hilbertification, the next step is to apply wavelet transforms, which are mathematical tools for analyzing signals at multiple scales. Unlike Fourier transforms, which only provide frequency information, wavelet transforms capture both frequency and spatial (or temporal) information, making them ideal for feature extraction in images.\n\n\n\nAnimation showing how wavelet transforms work. Courtesy of Wikipedia\n\n\nExperimentation\nSupport vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection. The advantages of support vector machines are that they are effective in high dimensional spaces, still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples, use a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient and versatile due to them supporting different Kernel functions which can be specified for the decision function. [5]\nThis was then followed by hilbertification, which is the process of serializing the image to the frequency domain as discussed earlier. This was then passed onto for localization.\nThe fundamental idea of wavelet transforms is that the transformation should allow only changes in time extension, but not shape, this means that it encapsulates a denser representation of our signal on the time domain such that it preserves the spatial relationships as changes in the time extension are expected to conform to the corresponding analysis frequency of the basis function [6].\nThis gives us a more dense set of features which is 1/4 the size of the original image.\n\n\n\n    A Sample of the Data Used, before and after the proposed hilbertification method\n\n\nTable below gives an overview of how my proposed method performs.\nNote that for my tests I had taken the entire image as a baseline.\nApart from the documented results show below,\nI have also compared my method to cosine-transformed version of the dataset,\nin which case the result of the cosine-transformed classifiers were abnormally low so I decided to not publish those as it maybe due to my own faulty implementation\nI had also tried CIFAR-10 dataset, since that dataset is a color dataset, I did not get time to properly implement the method for the dataset.\nResults of the Proposed Method\nDatasetMethodLinear SVMRBF KernelPolynomial Kernel\nFashion MNISTHilbertified87.27388.27587.991\nBaseline91.49389.91791.584\nMNISTHilbertified96.02696.53597.134\nBaseline98.31898.66199.288\n\nConclusions\nIn order to reduce the number of features that are being considered while classification is done and still achieve a better accuracy levels, I applied hilbertification to the dataset and then used wavelets to localize the features thus giving us a denser set of features almost one-fourth of the original image.\nThe results that I saw was not significantly lower when compared to the results obtained while considering all the features.\nThus, it can be said that my method indeed captures the spatial relationships as proposed.\nBased on this, I have come to believe that the proposed method is not only viable, it also encodes some of very useful spatial information in a very dense space.\nThis method can be extended extensively in future work by expanding to higher number of dimensions since it can efficiently encode temporal and spatial and even higher order dimensional data.\n\n\nFalconer, Kenneth (2003). “Fractal Geometry: Mathematical Foundations and Applications.” John Wiley &amp; Sons. xxv ISBN 0-470-84862-6. ↩\n\n\nvon Melchner, Laurie &amp; Pallas, Sarah &amp; Sur, Mriganka (2000) “Visual Behaviour Mediated by Retinal Projections Directed to the Auditory Pathway.” Nature 404 871-6. 10.1038/35009102. ↩\n\n\nBoeing, G.

Producers publish data to topics, and consumers subscribe to these topics to consume the data. It also stores data across multiple brokers and partitions, allowing it to scale horizontally.\nOne of the key challenges in maintaining Kafka’s performance is ensuring a balanced distribution of partitions across consumers. Kafka’s rebalancing process helps achieve this, but traditional approaches have significant drawbacks, leading to the introduction of incremental cooperative rebalancing as a more efficient alternative.\nKey Concepts in Kafka Rebalancing\nBefore diving into cooperative rebalancing, let’s review some essential Kafka concepts:\n\n\n\n    A Brief Overview of Kafka Architecture\n\n\n\nBrokers: Servers that manage the storage and transfer of data within Kafka clusters.\nPartition: A unit of parallelism within a Kafka topic, where each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records.\nConsumer Group: A set of consumers that collaboratively consume data from one or more topics, with each consumer being assigned partitions.\nRebalance: The process of redistributing partitions among consumer instances in a group.\nPartition Assignment Strategy: The algorithm Kafka uses to assign partitions, including round-robin, range, and sticky assignments.\n\nThe Traditional Rebalancing Problem\nKafka rebalancing is triggered when consumers join or leave a group, new partitions are added, or consumer failures occur. The traditional “stop-the-world” rebalancing process involves:\n\nKafka notifying all consumers to stop consuming data.\nConsumers rejoining the group and undergoing partition reassignment.\nConsumers resuming processing once the rebalance completes.\n\nThis approach comes with its fair share of challenges.\nOne major issue is increased latency—whenever rebalancing happens, consumers are temporarily paused, this obviously leads to delays in processing messages.\nThis can create bottlenecks, especially in systems that rely on real-time data flow. In my case the consumer service would start firing availability alerts on our pipelines if it took longer than 15minutes.\nOn some very high throughput topics, this would mean to increase the consumer group size temporarily to handle the extra load this causes, then scale it back. Overall baby sitting this was unnecessary burden.\nAnother concern is reduced throughput.\nFrequent rebalancing can disrupt the consumer group assignments, sometimes overloading some brokers and other times leaving them underutilized. This instability can make it harder to maintain optimal usage.\nAlso, there’s the problem of higher resource usage.\nEvery time partitions are moved around, it consumes CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.\nIn large-scale deployments like ours, these overheads can quickly add up, impacting overall system performance.\nFinally, there’s the risk of potential data loss.\nIf rebalancing isn’t handled carefully, unprocessed messages might slip through the cracks, leading to inconsistencies and gaps in the data pipeline, affecting some of our completeness guarantees.\nEnsuring that messages aren’t lost during transitions is another challenge for maintaining our SLAs.\nChallenges with Stop-the-World Rebalancing\nWhen I first started working with Kafka, I quickly ran into the quirks of its traditional rebalancing model.\nOn paper, it made sense—partitions get redistributed to keep things balanced.\nBut in reality, the process wasn’t as smooth as I had hoped, especially as the system grew in complexity.\nOne of the biggest pain points was scaling up and down. As we added more consumers or removed them, the rebalancing process became increasingly expensive.\nThe more resources there were to shuffle around, the longer everything took, making what should have been a simple operation a performance headache.\nThen there was multi-tenancy.\nIn shared environments where different teams were running diverse workloads, a single rebalancing event could unexpectedly impact someone else’s pipeline.\nI remember a time when our team’s batch processing job was disrupted mid-run simply because the consumer counts got adjusted on an unrelated topic.\nRolling upgrades were another tricky part.\nIdeally, updating our infrastructure shouldn’t disrupt workloads, but Kafka’s default rebalancing model didn’t play nicely with rolling restarts.\nI remember this one time, an upgrade window which caused a full rebalancing event, slowing things down so much that what should have been a minor version bump turned into a whole bunch of pages constantly buzzing me.\nIncremental Cooperative Rebalancing\nTo mitigate these issues, Kafka 2.4 introduced incremental cooperative rebalancing, which improves the rebalance process by allowing consumers to retain their current assignments while incrementally taking on new partitions. This approach minimizes disruptions and ensures a smoother transition.\nKey Improvements of Incremental Cooperative Rebalancing\n\nIncremental Partition Transfer: Only affected partitions are reassigned instead of stopping all consumers.\nContinuous Data Processing: Consumers remain active and process messages during rebalance.\nParallel Rebalancing: New consumers can join and consume data concurrently.\nGraceful Partition Handling: Consumers are given a grace period to return before partitions are reassigned.\nSticky Assignor Implementation: This strategy optimizes assignments by trying to retain previous partition allocations.\n\nHow Incremental Cooperative Rebalancing Works\nKafka clients use an embedded rebalance protocol to manage partition assignments autonomously without burdening Kafka brokers. The rebalancing process follows these steps:\n\nKafka sends a GroupCoordinator message to notify consumers.\nConsumers respond with a JoinGroup message to indicate participation.\nConsumers voluntarily release partitions that need reassignment.\nIncremental reassignment happens in multiple rounds without halting all consumers.\n\nThe process completes when the workload is evenly distributed across consumers.\nReducing Rebalance Frequency\nWhile rebalancing is necessary, frequent rebalances can degrade performance. Some best practices to reduce rebalancing events include:\n\nIncrease Session Timeout: Adjust session.timeout.ms to allow consumers more time to recover before being marked as inactive.\nOptimize Poll Intervals: Set max.poll.interval.ms to accommodate longer processing times.\nLimit Partitions per Topic: Reducing the number of partitions can decrease rebalance occurrences.\nUse Static Group Membership: Assign partitions manually to consumers for a fixed workload distribution.\n\nPerformance Improvements with Incremental Cooperative Rebalancing\nBenchmarks[1] have shown that incremental cooperative rebalancing drastically reduces rebalancing time and improves throughput in large-scale deployments. For instance, a test running 900 Kafka Connect tasks showed the following improvements:\n\nAggregate throughput increased by 113%.\nMedian throughput improved by 101%.\nMaximum throughput saw an 833% increase.\n\nThese improvements result from the ability of Kafka clients to absorb resource fluctuations gracefully without completely stopping operations.\nConclusion\nIncremental cooperative rebalancing in Kafka is a significant step forward in improving consumer group management. By transitioning from the traditional stop-the-world approach to a more gradual, cooperative model, organizations can achieve higher availability, scalability, and performance in their Kafka deployments.\nImplementing these techniques and understanding best practices ensures a more resilient and efficient streaming data pipeline, reducing disruptions and optimizing resource utilization.\n\n\nIncremental Cooperative Rebalancing in Apache Kafka: Why Stop the World When You Can Change It? ↩\n\n\n","id":"https://theanig.github.io/blog/incremental-cooperative-rebalancing-kafka/","title":"Understanding Cooperative Rebalancing in Apache Kafka"},"https://theanig.github.io/blog/ner-lstm-cnn-icml/":{"body":"Introduction\nIf you’ve ever dipped your toes into natural language processing (NLP), you’ve probably come across tasks like part-of-speech (POS) tagging and named entity recognition (NER). These are the bread and butter of understanding text—things like figuring out whether “Apple” in a sentence refers to a fruit or a tech giant. But let’s be honest, the traditional ways of handling these tasks? Not exactly user-friendly. They usually involve manually crafting features and preprocessing data for hours. It’s tedious, time-consuming, and doesn’t always translate well when you try to apply it to new types of text.\nThat’s where a groundbreaking paper from ACL 2016 comes in: End-to-end Sequence Labeling via Bi-directional LSTM-CNNs-CRF by Xuezhe Ma and Eduard Hovy[1]. Don’t let the fancy title scare you—this paper is a game-changer. It proposes a neural network model that completely flips the script on the traditional approach. Instead of hand-picking features, it combines character-level representations (thanks to Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs) with word-level context (handled by Bi-directional LSTMs). The cherry on top? A Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer that ties everything together for structured predictions.\nWhat’s so cool about this? Well, for starters, it’s an end-to-end model, which means it handles the entire process without requiring you to do all that annoying feature engineering. You just give it data, and it learns what it needs—automatically. It’s versatile too, working across a range of sequence labeling tasks.\nAnd the results? Pretty impressive. This model hit 97.55% accuracy on POS tagging with the Penn Treebank WSJ dataset and scored a solid 91.21% F1 on NER using the CoNLL 2003 dataset. Those are state-of-the-art numbers, by the way.\nSince its debut, this paper has left a big mark on the NLP community. It’s inspired a wave of follow-up research and implementations, all riffing on this idea of combining different neural network components into a single powerful system. This emphasis on end-to-end learning has made sequence labeling faster, easier, and way more adaptable.\nReproducibility\nThis is why I took this paper as a good candidate to present for reproducibility[2].\nIt’s a standout example of a complex yet impactful model, combining multiple neural network components into an end-to-end framework. The paper doesn’t just offer strong theoretical contributions; it also provides practical results that have influenced a significant portion of subsequent NLP research. By breaking down the BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model step-by-step, I wanted to demonstrate how a state-of-the-art system could be reproduced with modern tools like PyTorch, ensuring others could verify the results and, ideally, build upon them.\nReproducibility in this case meant more than just rerunning the experiments—it meant making the implementation accessible, understandable, and adaptable to different use cases. During my preparation, I paid close attention to the potential pain points: ensuring the code was platform-agnostic, tuning hyperparameters to match those used in the paper, and structuring the codebase so others could easily tweak it for related tasks. The aim was to not only replicate the model’s impressive benchmark performance but to encourage further experimentation and adoption by the community.\nAt the ICML workshop, this example opened up broader conversations about what it takes to make machine learning research truly reproducible. The discussion often circled back to the tools we use to share code and results. For instance, while frameworks like PyTorch offer flexibility and power, simply uploading a GitHub repository isn’t enough if it lacks proper documentation or doesn’t account for different computational setups. The group also explored the importance of including detailed training procedures and hyperparameter configurations—often overlooked but critical for achieving comparable results.\nTutorial\n\n\t\n\t\tNote\n\tFeel free to check out the linked repository to follow along with this article to implement your own state of the art NER pipeline\n\n\nData Preparation\nBefore we dive into the model, let’s prepare the data. We’ll use the CoNLL 2003 dataset, which contains text tagged for four types of named entities: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, and MISC.\nThe dataset uses the BIO tagging scheme, where:\n\nB-TYPE indicates the beginning of an entity of type TYPE.\nI-TYPE indicates the continuation of the entity.\nO indicates that the word is not part of any entity.\n\nFor example,\n\nWe also preprocess the text by replacing all digits with 0. This step ensures that the model focuses on meaningful textual patterns instead of numeric details, which are often irrelevant in NER tasks.\n\nTo align with the paper, we convert the tags to the BIOES scheme, which provides finer granularity by adding:\n\nE-TYPE for the end of an entity.\nS-TYPE for single-token entities.\n\n\nMappings and Word Embeddings\nTo train our model, we need to convert words, characters, and tags into numeric representations. This mapping allows us to leverage efficient matrix operations in PyTorch. For word embeddings, we use pre-trained GloVe vectors (100-dimensional) trained on Wikipedia and Gigaword data. These embeddings provide a semantic representation of words, which significantly boosts the model’s performance.\n\nWe also load GloVe embeddings into a matrix and initialize missing embeddings randomly:\n\nModel Architecture\nThe BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model has three main components:\n\n\nCNN for Character Embeddings: Generates a character-level representation for each word using convolutional and max-pooling layers. This step captures morphological patterns like prefixes and suffixes.\n\n\nBiLSTM for Word Encoding: Combines word embeddings (GloVe + character embeddings) and processes them bidirectionally. This helps capture context from both the left and right of each word.\n\n\nCRF for Structured Prediction: Ensures that predictions respect tagging constraints (e.g., I-ORG cannot follow I-PER).\n\n\nThe model that we are presenting is a complicated one, since its a hybridized network using LSTMs and CNNs. So in order to break down the complexity, we have attempted to simplify the process by splitting up operations into individual functions that we can go over part by part. This hopefully makes the whole thing more easily digestable and gives a more intuitive understanding of the whole process.\nInitialization of weights\nWe start with the init_embedding function, which just initializes the embedding layer by pooling from a random sample.\nThe distribution is pooled from $-\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{V}}$ to $+\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{V}}$ where $V$ is the embedding dimension size.\n\nThe LSTM layers are initialized by uniform sampling from $-\\sqrt{\\frac{6}{r + c}}$ to $+\\sqrt{\\frac{6}{r + c}}$. Where $r$ is the number of rows, $c$ is the number of columns (based on the shape of the weight matrix).\n\nCRF Layer\nWe have two options:\n\n\nsoftmax: normalize the scores into a vector such that can be interpreted as the probability that the word belongs to class. Eventually, the probability of a sequence of tag $y$ is the product of all tags.\n\n\nlinear-chain CRF: the first method makes local choices. In other words, even if we capture some information from the context thanks to the bi-LSTM, the tagging decision is still local. We don’t make use of the neighbooring tagging decisions. Given a sequence of words $w_1, …, w_m$, a sequence of score vectors\n$s_1, …, s_m$ and a sequence of tags $y_1, …, y_m$, a linear-chain CRF defines a global score $C \\in \\R$ such that\n\n\n$$\nC(y_1, …, y_m) = b[y_1] + \\sum_{t=1}^m s_t[y_t] + \\sum_{t=1}^{m-1}T[y_t, y_{t+1}] + e[y_m]\n$$\nwhere $T$ is a transition matrix in $\\R^{9x9}$ and $e, b \\in \\R^9$ are vectors of scores that capture the cost of beginning or ending with a given tag. The use of the matrix $T$ captures linear (one step) dependencies between tagging decisions.\nThe motivation behind CRFs was to generate sentence level likelihoods for optimal tags. What that means is for each word we estimate maximum likelihood and then we use the Viterbi algorithm to decode the tag sequence optimally.\nAdvantages of CRF over Softmax:\n\nSoftmax doesn’t value any dependencies, this is a problem since NER the context heavily influences the tag that is assigned. This is solved by applying CRF as it takes into account the full sequence to assign the tag.\nExample: I-ORG cannot directly follow I-PER.\n\n\n\n\nA simple CRF network\n\n\nThe figure shows a simple CRF network, in our case we have the inputs feeding in from our BiLSTMs, but otherwise the structure largely remains the same.\nScore Calculation\nCRF computes a conditional probability. Let $y$ be a tag sequence and x an input of sequence of words. Then we compute\n$$\nP(y|x) = \\frac{exp(Score(x, y))}{\\sum_{y’}exp(Score(x, y’))}\n$$\nWhere the score is determined by defining some log potentials $log\\psi_i(x, y)$ such that\n$$\nScore(x, y) = \\sum_i log\\psi_i(x, y)\n$$\n\nThis is the score function for our sentences. This function takes a list of ground truths that tell us what the corresponding tags are and the features which contains the supposed tagged parts of the function. Which is then used to compute the score.\n\nViterbi decode\nViterbi decode is basically applying dynamic programming to choosing our tag sequence. Let’s suppose that we have the solution\n$$ \\tilde s_t(y_t) = argmax_{y_t, …, y_m} C(y_t, …, y_m) = argmax_{y_{t+1}}s_t[y_t] + T[y_t, y_{t+1}] + \\tilde s_{t+1}(y^{t+1}) $$\nThen, we can easily define the probability of a given sequence of tags as\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(y_1, …, y_m) = \\frac{e^{C(y_t, …, y_m)}}{Z}\n$$\n\nModel Details\nCNN model for generating character embeddings\nConsider the word ‘cat’, we pad it on both ends to get our maximum word length ( this is mainly an implementation quirk since we can’t have variable length layers at run time, our algorithm will ignore the pads).\n\n\n\n    Convolution Model for generating character embeddings\n\n\nWe then apply a convolution layer on top that generates spatial coherence across characters, we use a maxpool to extract meaningful features out of our convolution layer. This now gives us a dense vector representation of each word. This representation will be concatenated with the pre-trained GloVe embeddings using a simple lookup.\nThis snippet shows us how the CNN is implemented in pytorch\n\nLSTM model that generates tags for the given sequence\nThe word-embeddings( glove+char embedding ) that we generated above, we feed to a bi-directional LSTM model. The LSTM model has 2 layers,\n\n\n\n    LSTMs for Tag Generation\n\n\n\n\nThe forward layer takes in a sequence of word vectors and generates a new vector based on what it has seen so far in the forward direction (starting from the start word up until current word) this vector can be thought of as a summary of all the words it has seen.\n\n\nThe backwards layer does the same but in opposite direction, i.e., from the end of the sentence to the current word.\n\n\nThe forward vector and the backwards vector at current word concatanate to generate a unified representation.\n\n\nThis snippet shows us how the BiLSTM is implemented in pytorch\n\nMain Model Implementation\nThe get_lstm_features function returns the LSTM’s tag vectors. The function performs all the steps mentioned above for the model.\nSteps:\n\nIt takes in characters, converts them to embeddings using our character CNN.\nWe concat Character Embeeding with glove vectors, use this as features that we feed to Bidirectional-LSTM.\nThe Bidirectional-LSTM generates outputs based on these set of features.\nThe output are passed through a linear layer to convert to tag space\n\n\nTraining the model\nWe train the model using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.015 and momentum of 0.9. To avoid overfitting, we apply dropout and use gradient clipping\n\nWe also calculate the negative log-likelihood as our loss function:\n\nEvaluation and Testing\nAfter training, we evaluate the model using precision, recall, and F1-score. Here’s an example of the model tagging new sentences:\n\nThis gives us the output:\n\n… and that’s it! That gets us a state of the art NER pipeline!\nClosing Thoughts\nPresenting this work at the workshop was an incredibly rewarding experience.
